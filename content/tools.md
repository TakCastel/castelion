# The soft skills

I am experienced in working with Git workflows, utilizing branching, merging, and pull requests to ensure smooth collaboration and version control in development teams. I follow best practices for code management, ensuring consistent, efficient, and error-free code integration.

I am also familiar with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, having used them to deploy applications, manage databases, and implement serverless functions. My experience with these platforms has enabled me to build scalable, secure, and high-performance applications while optimizing backend processes.

## Tools I'm familiar with

### Postman

I use Postman for API documentation and testing, ensuring endpoints are well-documented and functional. It helps streamline collaboration, keeping API details accurate and up-to-date for smooth integration between teams.
