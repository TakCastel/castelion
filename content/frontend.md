# Front End Developer

With 6 years as a Frontend Developer, I specialize in building responsive, maintainable applications using Vue.js and Nuxt.js. I create scalable UI components, implement SSR and static rendering, and optimize performance across devices and browsers, prioritizing clean, maintainable code for long-term growth.

I have strong skills in API integration and data management (using Vuex or Pinia) and work closely with backend teams and designers to deliver seamless, functional, and visually appealing user experiences.

## Use cases

### MesArbustes

As a Frontend Developer at Motion4Ever, I was tasked with updating the entire site theme for  [mesarbustes.fr](https://www.mesarbustes.fr/). 

I developed a fully responsive Prestashop theme based on detailed graphic mockups, ensuring a seamless and visually consistent experience across all devices. Working closely with the backend team, I integrated custom Prestashop modules, optimized the site’s SEO with structured data, and improved overall performance.

This project enhanced the site’s aesthetics, functionality, and search engine visibility, aligning the user experience closely with the brand’s vision.
