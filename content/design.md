# Designing Systems

As a designer, I can build comprehensive Design Systems based on Atomic Design principles, breaking down interfaces into smaller, reusable components that can be easily scaled and maintained. 

I can also follow Material Design principles to ensure a clean, user-friendly interface that aligns with modern Google Material design standards. 

By creating reusable UI components, defining clear guidelines, and establishing responsive layouts, I ensure consistency across platforms. This approach helps streamline the design process and delivers a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

## Use cases

During my collaboration with Gingerminds, I was tasked with implementing a UI library from scratch for [proreno.fr](https://www.proreno.fr/), using Nuxt 3, Tailwind, and TypeScript. I developed components based on Atomic Design principles and followed the design system guidelines from Figma.

This allowed me to create a scalable and consistent set of UI elements, ensuring that the interface was both visually cohesive and aligned with the brand’s design system.

The result was a flexible, maintainable, and high-quality library that streamlined development and improved the overall user experience.

### PrimeVue

Aside with these design systems, I also like to use PrimeVue for building rich and interactive user interfaces with a wide range of pre-built components. It helps speed up development with customizable, responsive UI components while maintaining a consistent design language.
